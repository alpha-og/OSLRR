## Types of Materials

1. **Perfectly Elastic**
    - Completely regains shape after being deformed by an external force, after the external force is removed
    - All work done is stored as potential energy within the body
    - No loss of energy occurs
    - //Figure
2. **Inelastic**
    - Partially regains shape after being deformed by an external force, after the external force is removed
    - Most of the work done is stored as potential energy within the body
    - Partial loss of energy occurs
    - Figure
3. **Perfectly Inelastic**
    - Does not regains shape after being deformed by an external force, after the external force is removed
    - Work done is not stored as potential energy
    - Complete loss of energy occurs
    - //Figure

> [!Note] 
> Elasticity does not refer to the ability of a material to stretch, rather it refers to the ability of a material to regain its shape after being elongated or compressed.

## Effects of Force

- Deformation: Change in shape, size, volume, etcâ€¦ (OR) Change in Configuration
- Bonds between atoms will be elongated and/ or compressed
- Restoring force is developed within the body

**Deforming Force:** It is the force which causes deformation

**Restoring Force:** It is the internal force developed inside the material due to deformation
