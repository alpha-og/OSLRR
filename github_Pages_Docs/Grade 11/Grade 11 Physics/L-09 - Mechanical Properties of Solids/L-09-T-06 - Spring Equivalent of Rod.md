# Spring Equivalent of Rod

Figure

$x$: Displacement of Spring End/ Change in Length

$l$: Original length of spring

$Y = \frac{Fl}{A\Delta l}$ #1

$F_s = kx$ #2

Taking $F = F_s$ and $\Delta l = x$ in #1,

$\Rightarrow F_s = \frac{YAx}{l}$ #3

Using #2 in #3,

$\Rightarrow kx = \frac{YAx}{l}$
$$\therefore k = \frac{YA}{l}$$
