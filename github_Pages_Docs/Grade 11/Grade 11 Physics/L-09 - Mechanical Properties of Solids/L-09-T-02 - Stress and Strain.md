## Stress

- Stress is defined as the restoring forced developed per unit area
- $Stress = \frac{F_{r}}{A}$ | $F_r$: Restoring Force | $A$: Area
- Unit: $Nm^{− 2}$
- Dimension: $[ML^{-1}T^{-2}]$
- Stress is a tensor quantity of rank 2

**Note:**

- $Stress \neq Pressure$
- Scalar Quantity: Tensor [Rank-0]
- Vector Quantity: Tensor [Rank-1]

### Types Of Stress

1. Longitudinal/ Normal Stress
    - The stress developed within a body due to a force acting normally(perpendicularly) to the surface of the object is known as *Normal Stress*
    - $Normal\space Stress = \frac{F_N}{A}$ $|$ $F_N$: Normal Force
    - Figure
2. Volumetric Stress
    - The stress developed within a body due to a force acting perpendicular to the surface of the object that results in change in volume is known as *Volumetric Stress*
    - $Volumetric\space Stress = \frac{F_L}{A}$ | $F_L$: Force due to Liquid
    - Figure
3. Shear Stress
    - The stress developed within a body due to a force acting tangential to the surface of the object which results in change of shape of the object is known as shear stress.
    - $Shear\space Stress = \frac{F_T}{A}$ $|$ $F_T$: Tangential Force $|$ $A$: Area of plane on which force acts

## Strain

- Strain is defined as the relative change in configuration when stress is developed in the body.
- $Stress = \frac{Change\space in\space Configuration}{Original\space Configuration}$
- Unit: None
- Dimension: $[M^0L^0T^0]$

### Types of Strain

1. Longitudinal Strain

//Figure

$Longitudinal\space Strain = \frac{Change\space in\space Length}{Original\space Length}$

$\Rightarrow Longitudinal\space Strain = \frac{l'-l}{l}$
$$\therefore Longitudinal\space Strain = \frac{\Delta l}{l}$$
2. Volumetric Strain

Figure

$Volumetric\space Strain = \frac{Change\space in\space Volume}{Original\space Volume}$

$\Rightarrow Volumetric\space Strain = \frac{V'-V}{V}$
$$\therefore Volumetric\space Strain = \frac{\Delta V}{V}$$
3. Shear Strain

Figure

$Shear\space Strain = \tan{\theta}$

$\Rightarrow Shear\space Strain = \theta =\tan\theta$
$$\therefore Shear\space Strain = \frac{x}{h}$$
Note: Since $\theta$ is very small, $\tan{\theta}$ can be considered equal to $\theta$

## Stress-Strain Graph

- Hook’s Law: It states that upto a certain limit of stress for a material, the stress is directly proportional to strain.
    
    The limit is known as Hook’s Limit
    

//Figure

> In stress-strain graph, 
> $$slope = \frac{stress}{strain}$$
> $$Tensile \space Strength \propto Ultimate\space Stress$$
> $$Malleability \propto Extent\space of\space Necking\space Region$$

OA →Hook’s Region: Region in which Hooke’s Law holds true

BC → Plastic Region: Region in which any deformation made on material is permanent

CD → Necking Region: Region in which material begins to flow

A → Hook’s Limit: Point upto which Hook’s Law is valid

B → Yield Point: Point beyond which object becomes plastic/ non elastic

C → Ultimate Stress Point: Point at which stress on material is at the highest it can withstand before breaking

D → Fracture Point: Point at which material breaks
