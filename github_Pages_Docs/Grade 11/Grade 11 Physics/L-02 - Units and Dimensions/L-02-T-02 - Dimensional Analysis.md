[[L-02 - Important Dimensions]]

- **Principle of Homogenity**: Addition, subtraction or equation of physical quantities can ve performed only between same physical quantities

**Application**
- Determining dimensional correctness of formulae
- Derivation of formula
- Conversion from one system of units to another

**Limitations**
- Can only be used to determine dimensional correctness of formulae and not actual correctness
- Cannot be used to derive values of proportionality constants
- Cannot be used to derive formula of quantities which depend on more than 3 variables
- Cannot be used to derive formula using relations which contain trigonometric, logarithmic or exponential functions
- Can only be used to derive formula of quantities which are a result of product of other physical quantities
