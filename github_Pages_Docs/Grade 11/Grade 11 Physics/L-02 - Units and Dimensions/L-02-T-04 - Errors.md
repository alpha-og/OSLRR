- An error, is a mistake of some kind so that the obtained result is not accurate

**Types of errors**
	1. Systematic 
	2. Random

### Random Errors
- Has no pattern and are usually unavoidable
- Cannot be rectified but can be minimized
- Can be reduced by taking a lot of readings, and calculating the average (mean)
- **Causes:**
    - Human error
    - Faulty technique

### Systematic Errors
- Consistent, repeatable error associated with faulty equipment or a flawed experiment design
- These errors cause readings to be shifted one way from the true reading
- **Causes**
    1. Zero Error: 
        - Example: There is no weight placed but the weighing machine is not showing zero
    2. Faulty Instrument: 
        - Example: Wrongly calibrated instruments, Instrument which has been deformed
    3. Personal Error: 
        - Example: Parallax Error

### Calculation of Errors
Values obtained in several measurements are $a_1, a_2, a_3....a_n$

**Mean Value**
- Mean value of all the measurements
$$
\overline{a} = \frac{\overset{n}{\underset{i=0}\Sigma}{a_i}}{n}
$$

**Absolute Error**
It is the magnitude of the difference between the individual measurement and the true value of the quantity
- It is denoted by $\Delta a$
- It is always taken as positive
$$
\Delta a_n = |\overline{a} - a_n|
$$

**Mean Absolute Error**
- Sum of all absolute errors divided by the number of measurements made
$$
\overline{\Delta{a}} = \frac{\overset{n}{\underset{i=0}\Sigma}{\Delta a_i}}{n}
$$

**Measurement/ Result**
$$
a = \overline{a}\pm \overline {\Delta a}
$$

### Relative Errors
It is the ratio of the mean absolute error $\Delta a_{mean}$ to the mean value $a_{mean}$ of the quantity measured
$$
Relative\space Error = \frac{\Delta a}{\overline a}
$$

### Percentage Errors
It is the relative error expressed in percentage
$$
Percentage\space Error (\delta) = \frac{\Delta a}{\overline a}\times 100
$$

### Rules

**Addition and Subtraction**
- Absolute errors add up to give net absolute error

**Multiplication and Division**
- Relative errors add up to give net relative error
- Example: 
$A = L \times B$
$\frac{\Delta A}{A} = \frac{\Delta L}{L} + \frac{\Delta B}{B}$
