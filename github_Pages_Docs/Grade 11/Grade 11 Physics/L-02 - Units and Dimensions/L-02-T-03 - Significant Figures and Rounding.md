### Rules for determining the significant figures in a number

1. All non-zero digits are significant
2. Zeroes appearing between non-zero digits are significant
3. Zeroes to the right of a non zero number but left of assumed decimal point are insignificant
4. Zeroes to the right of a non zero number but left of decimal point are significant
5. Zeroes to the left of a non zero number but right of decimal point are insignificant provided there are no non zero digits to the left of the decimal point
6. Zeros to the right of decimal point which are also to the right of a non zero digit are significant

### Rules for rounding

If the digit to be dropped is:

1. less than 5, then drop it and digit preceding it remains unchanged
2. greater than 5, then drop it and add 1 to the digit preceding it
3. Five
    1. If the preceding digit is even, then drop the digit
    2. If the preceding digit is odd, then add 1 to it and drop digit

**Addition and Subtraction:** Result should retain the number of decimal places as of the number of having least decimal places

**Multiplication and Division:** Result should have the number of significant digits of the number having the least of it
