This repository is meant to serve as a home for educational resources for students. This entire project is designed with student needs kept in mind. It is recommended to clone this repository locally and use obsidian or any other markdown based notes app which supports backlinks for complete continuity and ease of use.

Some things you need to know before continuing:
1. The contents of the repository are still being populated and will be filled up in the upcoming months. 
2. The github pages hosted version of this repository will either have missing contents or latex that hasn't rendered until I manage to resolve the issue with mathjax not working on the contents of this repo as intended, on github pages.
3. The resources provided here may or may not contain errors, discrepancies or inconsistencies; if found it must be reported by opening an issue.

# Prerequisites
The prerequisites for grades 11 and 12 are listed below. These prerequisites are broad and not specific to any chapter as these concepts tend to be used all across their respective subjects. These are not the only prerequisites for every chapter in the syllabus for grade 11 and 12. It is imperative that some grade 11 concepts serve as foundation for grade 12 and one must learn those concepts well, before looking into grade 12 chapters. Chapter specific prerequisites are mentioned alongside the table of contents for each grade on a per subject basis.

## Physics
1. Basics of Vectors
2. Basics of Calculus
3. Basics of Trigonometry

## Chemistry
1. Mole Concept
2. Basics of Atomic Model
3. Basics of Chemical Equations

## Mathematics
1. Solving Inequalities
2. Basics of Trigonometry

# Grade-11
Grade 11 provides foundational knowledge for higher studies and requires some basic concepts from grade 9 and 10 as well. 

## Physics
The syllabus includes kinematics, mechanics and thermodynamics, broadly

# Contributions
Contributions to the project are always welcome. We suggest you to adhere to the following guidelines when making a pull request:
1. Names of chapters and subjects to be given a header 1 size with a single hash ``# Chapter/Subject``
2. Names of topics to be given a header 2 size with a double hash ``## Topic``
3. Any further bifurcations, i.e subtopics of topics must follow suit by adding extra hashes to indicate heirarchy
