### Screw Gauge
{image}
- Main components
    - Pitch/Main scale
    - Circular scale
- **Pitch**: distance travelled in one rotation of the screw
- $MSD$: Main Scale Division | $MSR$: Main Scale Reading
    
    $CSD$: Circular Scale Division | $CSR$: Circular Scale Reading
- The $CSR$ is the reading of circular scale matching the horizontal line
- 1 complete rotation on circular scale of $n$ divisions completes or spans across the pitch, i.e $n CSD = 1 MSD$
- Least Count: $L.C = \frac{Pitch}{number\space of\space CSD}$
$$
Reading = MSR + L.C \times CSR
$$

**Initial Errors**
- Positive error
    - aka: excess error
    - 0 on circular scale will be below the horizontal line
    - 0 on main scale will be visible
    - Subtracted from reading
- Negative error
    - 0 on circular scale will be above horizontal line
    - 0 on main scale will not be visible
    - Added to reading

### Vernier Caliper

- $MSD$: Main Scale Division | $MSR$: Main Scale Reading
  $VSD$: Vernier Scale Division | $VSR$: Vernier Scale Reading
- 1 $MSD$ is the smallest division on the main scale while 1 $VSD$ is the smallest division on the vernier scale
- $MSR$ is the main scale reading while $VSR$ is the vernier scale division matching a line on the main scale
- Least Count: $L.C = 1MSD - 1VSD$
$$
R = MSR + LC \times VSR
$$

**Initial Errors**
- Positive error
    - 0 reading of vernier scale lies to the right of 0 reading of main scale
    - Subtracted from reading
    - $Error = VSR \times LC$
- Negative error
    - 0 reading of vernier scale lies to the left of 0 reading of main scale
    - Added to reading
    - $Error = 1MSD-VSR\times LC$
